# Personal Portfolio Website

Welcome to my personal portfolio site! This is where I showcase my projects, skills, and current work as a Computer Science and Economics student at Wake Forest University.

## About the Site

This website was designed and built from scratch using:
- **Next.js** for server-side rendering and routing
- **React** for interactive UI components
- **Tailwind CSS** for fast and modern styling
- **React Icons** for scalable vector icons

It’s responsive, lightweight, and easy to maintain—designed to reflect both my technical background and creative personality.

## Features

- Smooth scroll-based navigation  
- Fully responsive layout (desktop, tablet, mobile)  
- Dynamic project and experience sections  
- Clean, modular code for easy updates
