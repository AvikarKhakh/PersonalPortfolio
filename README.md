# Personal Portfolio Website

Welcome to my personal portfolio site! This is where I showcase my projects, skills, and current work as a Computer Science and Economics student at Wake Forest University.

## 🚀 About the Site

This website was designed and built from scratch using:
- **Next.js** for server-side rendering and routing
- **React** for interactive UI components
- **Tailwind CSS** for fast and modern styling
- **React Icons** for scalable vector icons

It’s responsive, lightweight, and easy to maintain—designed to reflect both my technical background and creative personality.

## 📂 Features

- Smooth scroll-based navigation  
- Fully responsive layout (desktop, tablet, mobile)  
- Dynamic project and experience sections  
- Clean, modular code for easy updates  

## 🧠 What I’m Up To Now

- Leading Wake Forest’s Robotics Club and mentoring others in autonomous robotics  
- Exploring cloud engineering and backend systems through hands-on projects  
- Building side projects that blend AI, finance, and automation
